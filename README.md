# Reflex Game

A reaction time-based game with each rounding lasting 30 seconds. The goal is to click as many targets within the allotted time while the targets randomly resize and
reposition. The panel on the right displays the time remaining, current score and high score which are updated using DOM Manipulation. setInterval is used to
countdown the time remaining and update the value in the display panel. setTimeout stops the game, removes the target and allows the user to start again.
